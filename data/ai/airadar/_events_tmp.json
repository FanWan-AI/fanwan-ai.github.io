The environment includes a primitive sampler, as a self-contained means of interpreting these events as sound. For full expressivity, though, the system is best used as a generator of data for interpretation by an external musical instrument, such as a synthesizer.<p>The project was very directly inspired by Orca (<a href=\"https://100r.co/site/orca.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://100r.co/site/orca.html</a>).

Inspired by the cognitive process of conceptual blending, we introduce a novel UI workflow that allows developers to rapidly incorporate diverse aspects from design examples into work-in-progress UIs. We prototyped this workflow as Misty. Through an exploratory first-use study with 14 frontend developers, we assessed Misty’s effectiveness and gathered feedback on this workflow. Our findings suggest that Misty’s…",

We leverage a transformer architecture that operates on spacetime patches of video and image latent codes. Our largest model, Sora, is capable of generating a minute of high fidelity video. Our results suggest that scaling video generation models is a promising path towards building general purpose simulators of the physical world.",

The collaboration included an October 2021 workshop bringing together 30 disinformation researchers, machine learning experts, and policy analysts, and culminated in a co-authored report building on more than a year of research. This report outlines the threats that language models pose to the information environment if used to augment disinformation campaigns and introduces a framework for analyzing potential mitigations.

Summarization required 60k human labels; simpler tasks which continue text in various styles required only 5k. Our motivation is to move safety techniques closer to the general task of “machines talking to humans,” which we believe is key to extracting information about human values.",

We hope these strategies will encourage greater cooperation on the safe development of AI and lead to better global outcomes of AI.",

We hope these findings stimulate further research into this promising class of models.",

More broadly, these results show that neural network training need not be considered a mysterious art, but can be rigorized and systematized.",
