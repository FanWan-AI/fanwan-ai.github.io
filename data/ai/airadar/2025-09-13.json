The system is much like a cellular automaton, in that most of the rules governing the evolution of the system are local.<p>C36 programs describe sequences of discrete events in time. The environment includes a primitive sampler, as a self-contained means of interpreting these events as sound. For full expressivity, though, the system is best used as a generator of data for interpretation by an external musical instrument, such as a synthesizer.<p>The project was very directly inspired by Orca (<a href=\"https://100r.co/site/orca.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://100r.co/site/orca.html</a>).
